            I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and should graduate in the spring of 2026. This course isn't
            required for my major, but I decided to get a certificate in web development because I thought it 
            would be a useful skill to know for the future in addition to my major.

            When I'm not at work or doing school, I enjoy wooworking. I've built several things recently such
            bookshelves, a table, nightstand, and wagon wheel. Other than woodworking I also love sports, 
            mainly basketball and running.
